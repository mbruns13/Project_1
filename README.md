# Spotify Project Proposal
Group Project 1


## Project Title: 
The Spotify API Analysis 

## Team Members: 
Molly Bruns, Sydney Cohen, Maite Rivas,  B Slone

## Project Description/Outline: 
Analyze various audio features of publicly available spotify top charts for the week of June 2nd 2022 to see how a given audio feature is represented in top songs 

## Research Questions to answer: 
* Does tempo significantly impact the danceability of global top songs?
* Is there any significant relationship between the danceability and energy of global top songs?
* Does energy help us predict the valence of top songs? 
* Is there any significant relationship between a top song’s duration and its other audio audio features?

## Datasets to Be Used:
* Publicly available spotify top charts found at charts.spotify.com/home
* Spotify API data based on song ID for songs of interest 

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
* Create dataframe of top songs of interest for given investigation
* Clean up raw csv from publicly available top charts 
* Loop through spotify API to pull variable of interest 
* Basic visualizations and statistical analysis to determine interesting correlations and trends based on question
* Choose and create useful visualizations and explain inferences 

## Findings
* **Does tempo significantly impact the danceability of global top songs?**</br>


* **Is there any significant relationship between the danceability and energy of global top songs?**</br>


* **Does energy help us predict the valence of top songs?**</br> 


* **Is there any significant relationship between a top song’s duration and its other audio audio features?**</br>
There were no strong correlations between a song's duration and the following audio features: tempo, energy, danceability, weeks on chart, rank, or number of streams. Most songs in the Global Top Songs Chart between 5/27/22 and 6/2/22 were between 2.91 and 3.85 minutes long. The songs from the same time period on the US chart were similar, with most songs lasting between 2.90 and 3.94 minutes long.
